qdb.pl by suppy

This is a quote database script written in perl


Prerequisites
=============

To use this quote database, you will need:
  * SQLite
  * perl 5.10.1 or higher
  * Mojolicious
  * Mojolicious::Plugin::Database
  * Regexp::Common

If you've got sqlite and perl, you can install the other prerequisites by:

   sudo cpan Mojolicious::Plugin::Database
                        # ^ this will pull in Mojolicious as well
   sudo cpan Regexp::Common


Configuration
=============

There is a qdb.conf.sample file included, which you can copy or move to
qdb.conf, and edit to your likings.

   cp qdb.conf.sample qdb.conf
   vim qdb.conf

The hypnotoad settings are for which address(es) to bind the listening socket
to, and under which username/group to run. It's important that the user you
specify has read/write access to the directory where the qdb.db (see later)
will be located. If you intend to listen on port 80 (or any other port below
1024) you'll need to start it under a privileged account. It will switch to the
specified user after it has opened the port(s) it needs.

The title setting is for setting the main title of the qdb website.

The secrets setting is an array of "secrets" that will be used to encrypt the
cookies Mojolicious sends; if this is a guessable string, someone can
impersonate an admin without much difficulty. So make sure it's difficult to
guess. This is not something you will need to remember either, so random crap
is fine.

And lastly there's an admins hash, where each key is an admin username,
and each value is a password. You can add as many of these as you want, but
you need at least one. Otherwise you'll be unable to edit/delete/approve any
quotes.

By default, the database will be stored in a SQLite database file named qdb.db
in the current directory. You can change this by editing the dsn setting in the
database hash in the configuration file.


Running the qdb
===============

Mojolicious comes with the hypnotoad webserver, which you'll run by just doing:

   sudo hypnotoad qdb.pl

in the directory you extracted the qdb script to.

If you ever need to update the script, you can just rerun the hypnotoad
command; it will kill the old script gracefully with 0 downtime, and replace it
with the current version.


Not using hypnotoad
===================

Mojolicious is easy to get going as a normal CGI script, or using FastCGI, or
even under mod_perl, but it will be most efficient to run it under hypnotoad.
Therefore, other solutions will be up to the user to figure out.
